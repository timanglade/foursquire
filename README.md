A geo-jousting game for mobile devices.

*It's Fight Club meets Foursquare! It's Highlight meets Highlander! It's GameCenter meets Game of Thronesâ€¦*

## How To
- If you want to run your own server, you will need to check out [the server code](https://github.com/timanglade/foursquire-server) (designed to run on Heroku), your own [Usergrid account](http://usergrid.com) as well as an [Urban Airship account](http://urbanairship.com)
- Otherwise, just keep the app pointed to foursquire.herokuapp.com to use our test servers
- The App relies on Phonegap 1.8+, jQuery Mobile and should run fine on iPhones 4 and above.
